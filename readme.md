<h1>
JTI (Informatics Enginnering) Lecturers Information System
</h1>

**********************************************************

Made by me to be assigned as last great assignment of Project Subject at State Polytechnic of Malang.
The record of the database in this project comes from JTI (Informatics Engineering) Polinema itself
given by the lecturer of this subject to his students. It is going to be assigned to Mr. Rosa as the 
lecturer of this subject at 31th May 2020.

This project is used to manage the lecturers data, subject to be learned by students, and also to manage
the RPS and SAP of the entire subjects. It uses Codeigniter framework, so if there is any person who 
wants to modify it, firstly he/she needs to learn Codeigniter.
